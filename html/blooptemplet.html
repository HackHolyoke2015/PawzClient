    <BR><strong>Story:</strong> Bloop was found wondering the streets of West Haven, CT by Animal Officer Mclow. Bloop was underweight, cold, and hungry seeking only love as Offficer Mclow approached him. Bloop has been in our shelter for about a year looking for a loving  home. Bloop's favorite thing to do is cuddle, eat, and get his belly rubbed. An idea home for Bloop would be one with no other dogs, but he loves cats! In addition we would recommend someone who has pet experiance to adopt Bloop.
